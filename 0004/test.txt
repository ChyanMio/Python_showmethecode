One day the wind said to the sun, "Look at that man walking along the road. I can get his coat off more quickly than you can."
"We will see about that," said the sun. "I will let you try first."
So the wind tried to make the man take off his coat. He blew and blew, but the man only pulled his coat more closely around himself.
"I give up," said the wind at last. "I cannot get his coat off." Then the sun tried. He shone as hard as he could. The man soon became hot and took off his coat.
